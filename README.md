## Description

This project creates a workout tracker for the user to log exercises and track previous workouts.

## Usage

The user is brought to an initial landing page where they are prompted to enter a new workout. If a previous workout has been entered, the user will be shown the information of that workout, and be allowed to update the information to add exercises. When adding an exercise, the user is prompted with a series of questions including whether the workout is Resistance or Cardio training, what exercise is was performed, and the sets, weight, and duration of the workout.

As workouts are entered, the user can view the information on a user dashboard. The dashboard shows workout duration over previous days, as well as the pounds lifted on each day.
